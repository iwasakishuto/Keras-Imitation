# C-Extensions for Python

> **Cython** is an **optimising static compiler** for both the **[Python](https://www.python.org/about/)** programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on **Pyrex**). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself. **([Documentation](https://cython.org/#documentation))**

## How to Use

```sh
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
